# React Employee Directory
This app allows a user to quickly search a roster of employees by name and have a photo and some information about them be provided. The roster of employees is generated by an API call to randomuser.me

## Running the app
Follow the deployed link above or, to run in terminal, type 'npm start'. On the app page just type the name you want to search into the directory search bar and a roster of random employees will be generated.
